# Variables   
### Variables are all strings so the " symbols are useless. 

> Dim varName   
> Set varName = "yes"  
> Set varName = 50   

# Commenting
> 'This is a comment  
> 'Any line that starts with an apostrophe(') is a comment

# Printing
> Echo varName as Dim
> Echo Hello World  
























### Note: Type checking will be included with the C++ compiler.
### Note: This is not 100% VBA, It's modernized/changed by me due to my lack of langauge design.
